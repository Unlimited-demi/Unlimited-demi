## Projects

1. **Twitter Analysis**: Conducted sentiment analysis on Twitter data to understand public sentiment towards a specific topic or brand. Utilized the Twitter API to gather tweets, performed text preprocessing, and applied machine learning algorithms for sentiment classification.
2. **Sentiment Analysis**: Developed a sentiment analysis model to analyze customer reviews and classify them into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. Explored various text processing techniques, such as tokenization, stemming, and TF-IDF vectorization, and trained a machine learning model for sentiment classification.
3. **Cluster Analysis**: Applied cluster analysis techniques to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior. Utilized unsupervised learning algorithms, such as k-means clustering, and visualized the clusters to gain insights into customer segmentation and targeted marketing strategies.
4. **Data Visualization**: Created interactive visualizations using Python libraries, such as Matplotlib and Plotly, to communicate complex data patterns effectively. Developed informative dashboards and interactive plots to present data insights in a visually appealing manner.
5. **Fraud Detection**: Developed a fraud detection model using machine learning algorithms to identify fraudulent transactions in financial data. Implemented anomaly detection techniques, such as isolation forest or one-class SVM, to detect unusual patterns and flag potential fraudulent activities.
